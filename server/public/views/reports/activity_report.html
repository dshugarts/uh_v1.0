        The benefits of physical activity reach far and wide into any health-related biometric and 
        are far too numerous to list in this short excerpt. This statement is also true about the 
        lack of physical activity, although on this end of the spectrum the scale is tilted towards 
        metabolic diseases rather than health.
    </br>
</br>
        The World Health Organization has just recently declared physical inactivity as the 4th 
        leading cause of mortality in the world as wells as attributing it as one of the leading cause 
        of noncommunicable diseases (NCC) – such as: type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and 
        cancer.
    </br>
</br>
        In a manuscript published in the National Institute of Health (NIH) by the Human Health Services 
        (HHS) is estimated that elimination of physical inactivity can reduce 6-10% of all NCCs worldwide. 
        Potentially saving millions of lives and billions of dollars.
    </br>
</br>
        According to U.S. Surgeon’s general and in agreement with the guidelines set forth by the American 
        College of Sports Medicine, the devastating impacts of physical inactivity can be offset with as little as 
        150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week.
