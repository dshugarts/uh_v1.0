        The National Institute of Health (NIH) has established that age is an independent risk factor 
        for the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In others words, despite the presence 
        (or absence) of other risk factors age contributes to an increase in risk for developing some 
        form of heart disease.

    </br>
        It is of importance to note that risk for CVD development and life expectancy are not be used 
        as synonyms. Evidence suggests that in the absence of other risk factors longevity is significantly 
        increased.

        In conclusion, even though one can not stop the chronological declines observed in human 
        physiology one can attenuate its impacts by having physically active, nutritionally balanced, 
        and stress-coping habits.
