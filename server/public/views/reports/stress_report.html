        According to the American Psychological Association the three major causes of stress in the 
        U.S. today are money, work and family responsibilities, with 67%, 65% and 54% of Americans 
        reporting experiencing major feelings of stress in those categories, respectively. Adults 
        report stress to cause negative impacts on both their physical and mental health; yet, the 
        majority feel as if they do not do enough to proactively cope with it. 
    </br>
</br>
        The impacts of stress, if left unchecked, can lead to mental health diagnosis such as 
        depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders as well as changes in biometrics such as 
        increases in weight and/or blood pressure. Stress is also a well-known contributor to the 
        development of metabolic disease (i.e.: diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases. 
    </br>
</br>
        For example, the over reliance on the stress response is harmful in many ways and has a 
        direct impact on your cardiovascular system. The stress response causes a phenomenon in your 
        arteries known as vasoconstriction - the arteries of your body narrow in diameter in other to 
        facilitate blood flow to muscles and tissues. Each individual stress response elevates blood 
        pressure. With each, and more stressful, events leading to higher levels of Systolic and 
        Diastolic pressures. In other words, stress has a significant and powerful impact on blood 
        pressure.

        In its recent report on stress the APA also showcases alarming data that the younger section 
        of our population demonstrates the highest rate of “poor mental” health. However, as pointed 
        out by the Boynton Health’s College Student Health Survey, the amount of stress one has may 
        have less devastating impacts to one’s health if they are well suited to appropriately cope 
        with them. In other words, it may be more about learning to cope with current stressors rather 
        than eliminating or (even worse) neglecting its existence.
