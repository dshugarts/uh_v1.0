        Currently, physical inactivity has dethroned smoking as the world’s number cause of death. 
        The harmful impacts of physical inactivity includes abnormal metabolism activity as well as 
        the capacity to negate the benefits of regular physical activity.
    </br>
</br>
        The link between physical activity and poor health is not new. In the late 1940s a study 
        conducted with London’s bus drivers noticed that drivers had significantly higher rates of 
        cardiovascular diseases when compared to the conductors. Attributing this to the fact that 
        conductors were active while walking up and down aisles (and stairs) while bus driver sat for 
        the entire length of their shifts.
    </br>
</br>
        Modern societies have served to further decrease the need for physical activity and with it 
        we are observing higher than ever rates of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. A study 
        conducted in Australia, more recently (2012), linked sitting time to mortality rates concluding 
        that prolonged sitting lead to -5 years in longevity. Furthermore, and perhaps scarier, this 
        finding was still valid even if the individuals were physically active.
    </br>
</br>
        In more recent publications, and on the brighter side of light, researchers in Norway have 
        demonstrated that reducing physical inactivity (by increasing cardiorespiratory fitness) can 
        extend individuals life up to 5 years. In fact, for every significant increase if fitness 
        capacity (1 MET) individuals added (theoretically) 45 more days of living on this earth.
    </br>
</br>
        In light of past and future findings, prevention of prolong periods of physical inactivity 
        should be step #1 in the decreasing metabolic and heart diseases, and enhancing health.
