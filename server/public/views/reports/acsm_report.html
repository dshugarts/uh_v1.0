        The American College of Sports Medicine provides a research-based approach to the prevention 
        of cardiac events at the onset of physical activity. Over the years the panel has come to a 
        consensus that those at higher risk for a cardiac event with exercise are those with present 
        signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD, not diagnosed) and those diagnosed with a 
        CVD seeking new (higher) intensities of exercise. It is recommended that these individual 
        seek medical clearance prior to starting a new physical activity regimen.
    </br>
</br>
        The questions provided in our screening process represent those that are suggestive of CVD 
        that have perhaps never been diagnosed in the past. If you answered yes to any of the 
        questions above, please seek out clearance from your physician prior to starting any new 
        exercise program. If you have a diagnosed CVD, metabolic disease (such as diabetes), and/or 
        kidneys disease and are seeking an unaccustomed level of physical activity, please also refer 
        to your physician prior to starting.
