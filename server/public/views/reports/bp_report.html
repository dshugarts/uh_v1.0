    Blood Pressure is the measurement of pressure that blood exerts against the arterial walls during 
    two specific instances of heart functioning: contraction (systolic blood pressure) and relaxation 
    (diastolic blood pressure). Henceforth, blood pressure is always represented with two numbers: a 
    top number quantifying the pressure blood exerts on arterial walls as the heart contracts, and a 
    bottom number quantifying the pressure of blood on the arteryâ€™s wall as the heart relaxes.
</br>
</br>
    Blood pressure has a dose-response relationship to heart disease risk, in the sense that as blood 
    pressure rises so does the risk for developing a cardiovascular disease (CVD). Considered to be 
    the silent killer due to an absence in manifestation of physical and mental symptoms, high blood 
    pressure presents great challenges to the maintenance of heart health.

    The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have recently 
    updated guidelines for the identification of blood pressure, prevention strategies for risk 
    development, and treatment options for hypertension. The new guidelines establish that significant 
    risk for development of CVD start at blood pressure values falling within 130-139 mmHg of systolic 
    pressure and/or 80-89 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure (Stage I Hypertension). As risk for CVD 
    mortality increases with blood pressure, the ACC-AHA guidelines are established as follows:
</br>
</br>
    Elevated Blood Pressure: Systolic between 120-129 and Diastolic less than 80.
</br>
    Stage I Hypertension: Systolic between 130-139 or diastolic between 80-89.
</br>
    Stage II Hypertension: Stage 2: Systolic at least 140 or diastolic at least 90mmHg.
</br>
    Hypertensive Crisis: Systolic over 180 and/or diastolic over 120, with patients needing 
    prompt changes in medication if there are no other indications of problems, or immediate 
    hospitalization if there are signs of organ damage
