        Recently established as an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease 
        (CVD), it is the measurement of ones waist circumference. According to the National Heart, 
        Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) waist circumference is linked to metabolic disorders such 
        as type II diabetes, stroke, and heart diseases. In agreement, the Human Health Services 
        (HHS) in a manuscript published at the National Institute of Health (NIH) provided evidence 
        to the strong predictive power of waist size in predicting incidence of CVDs and found that 
        larger circumferences significantly increase the occurrence of heart problems.

        Accumulation of excess body fat tends to be centered on oneâ€™s waist in times of stress, in 
        the presence of poor nutrition, and in the absence of physical activity. Therefore, waist 
        size has been linked to systemic inflammation - a condition promoting of numerous metabolic 
        disorders; and therefore, extremely detrimental to health. It is a simple and cheap 
        measurement that is highly modifiable by controllable actions.
