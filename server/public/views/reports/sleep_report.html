        In a world where time is money, sleep is a luxury. This mentality has lead 33% of Americans 
        to get less than the 7 hours of sleep recommended for optimal health every night (Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention, CDC).
    </br>
</br>
        The impacts of chronic lack of sleep are multi-factorial and include declines in physical 
        health, mental cognition, and motor safety. The CDC has linked inadequate sleep (7 hours or 
        less) to increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type II diabetes, incidence of 
        stroke, and depression. 
    </br>
</br>
        nadequate sleep also poses a threat to others, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
        Administration (NHTSA) reported that a staggering 1 out of 25 adults surveyed had fallen 
        asleep behind the wheels in the last 30 days prior to the study. Drowsy driving is linked 
        annually to 83,000 crashes, of which 37,000 have lead to injuries and 886 have lead to 
        fatality. The NHTSA cautions consideration of the above statistics as they are far too 
        conservative; they estimate that up to 6,000 auto-fatalities can be linked to drowsy driving.
