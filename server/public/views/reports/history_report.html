        In a recent study published by the College of Family Physicians of Canada, evidence for 
        development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) based on family history is strong in the following 
        circumstances. The offspring of parents with premature CVD have a 60% to 75% risk increase for 
        CVD development. Additionally, siblings of patients with CVD have about a 40% risk increase.
</br>
</br>
    These findings are in agreement in numerous previous studies demonstrating similar strengths in 
    this relationship between CVD and family history. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
    (CDC) provides in its website similar information pertaining to this topic.

    Important to note that although family history, and hence the genes received for your parents, 
    are not modifiable it does not establish certainty of disease development. Habitual acts of 
    physical activity, proper nutrition, and stress management are key in moderating genes and 
    preventing likelihood of disease development.
