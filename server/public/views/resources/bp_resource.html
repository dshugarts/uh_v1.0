    <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
        The approach to treat and prevent hypertension is multi-factorial in nature and may
        include changes to your diet, stress, and physical activity. This is not to say that all
        must be modified at the same time; changes in any of these categories,
        independently, haven shown to be beneficial in reversing the rise in high blood
        pressure in symptomatic individuals.
</br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Nutrition</strong></h4>
        The recommend approach for those with hypertension is to follow the Dietary
        Approach for Stopping Hypertension (DASH) guidelines, which is supported by
        trusted organization such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLB)
        and the Mayo clinic. The hallmark of this action plan is to focus on consumption of
        vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy foods; along with moderate amounts of whole
        grains, fish, poultry and nuts. Due to the close relationship between Sodium intake
        and blood pressure a modified DASH does exist that emphasizes reduction of this
        mineral from your food.
    </br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Stress Management</strong></h4>
        Evolutionary speaking, stress is a natural human response to life-threatening situations. 
        As the human species evolved, and with it the commodities of modern life, we have stopped 
        concerning ourselves with lions and tigers, and have replaced the stress responses towards 
        more constant threats, such as job responsibilities, financial obligation, timely commutes, 
        etc. In fact, according to the American Psychological Association the three major causes of 
        stress in the U.S. today are money, work and family responsibilities, with 67%, 65% and 54% 
        of Americans reporting experiencing major feelings of stress in those categories, 
        respectively. 
    </br>
</br>
        In order to control your stress many strategies are available in which are easy and simple 
        to use. They can range from engaging in mind-body activities such as Yoga and meditation, 
        to simply spending time with loved ones and friends. The idea is for you to create an 
        environment in which you mind can be occupied by tasks that are enjoyable to you and 
        take your mind always from threats; not a fan of Yoga or a pint with friends? Find a new 
        hobby you can enjoy doing.
    </br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Physcial Activity</strong></h4>
        The minimum recommendation for physical activity of 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic 
        activity per week was not set arbitrarily. This, according to numerous research papers, is 
        the amount of time necessary for the body to respond to the effects of exercise in a positive 
        way. The benefits are too many to list here, but direct to blood pressure they include: 
        improved heart function, reduction in resting heart rate, increase vascularization of muscle, 
        and enhanced ability to manage stress (and its hormones) â€“ all in all an very effective way to 
        reduce blood pressure.
